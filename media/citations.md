  abstract: This article discusses the implementation of the low-level computer programming
    language for software known as WebAssembly. The authors comment on the use of
    WebAssembly in advanced web applications, including three-dimensional visualization,
    audio and video software, and gaming. The benefits of WebAssembly include its
    ability to function independent of the computer hardware and operating system
    on which it runs.
